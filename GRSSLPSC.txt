SSL eMail Sender

A complex SSL eMail Sender with data encryption and more.
Since I never found nothing on the WEB about Visaual Basic sample, I've
tryed to reuse an old HTTPS code to get a protected SSL connection to
send eMail (old project do nothing but contains the core).
Program is also able to attachments, CC, BCC comma separated addresses
to send a complete 128-RC4-MD5 Hush encrypted packets data.
More works is still to do but at the moment it does work almost fine.
For all HOTMAIL Users the configuration Server & Port is done.
Please Readme.txt before enter in IDE.
Special thanks to Jason K. Resch & Anonimous for old project sample.

Updated to communicate with SSL3.0 about Servers that supports fallback
at SSL2.0 protocol after initial handshake messages...
