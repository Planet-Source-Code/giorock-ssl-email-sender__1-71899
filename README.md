### Description

A complex SSL eMail Sender with data encryption and more.

Since I never found nothing on the WEB about Visaual Basic sample, I've

tryed to reuse an old HTTPS code to get a protected SSL connection to

send eMail (old project do nothing but contains the core).

Program is also able to attachments, CC, BCC comma separated addresses

to send a complete 128-RC4-MD5 Hush encrypted packets data.

More works is still to do but at the moment it does work almost fine.

For all HOTMAIL Users the configuration Server & Port is done.

Please Readme.txt before enter in IDE.

Special thanks to Jason K. Resch & Anonimous for old project sample.

NEWS 2012:

Updated to communicate with SSL3.0 about Servers that supports fallback

at SSL2.0 protocol after initial handshake messages...
